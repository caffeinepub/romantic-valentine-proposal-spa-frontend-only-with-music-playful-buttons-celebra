# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Apply a consistent premium “blush-glass” visual style and updated typography across the landing, returning transition, and celebration screens.

**Planned changes:**
- Load and apply Playfair Display for main headings, and switch all subtitles/body/button text to a clean sans-serif (Inter or Poppins), removing any prior cursive font usage across all screens.
- Update global colors to the specified dreamy palette, including the multi-stop background gradient, light readable text colors, and consistent primary/secondary button styling (including the Yes-button glow accent).
- Restyle the shared GlassCard to use a blush-tinted translucent glass effect with blur/border/shadow, and add a subtle pink bloom behind the main card, ensuring it’s consistent wherever GlassCard is used and remains readable/interactable on mobile.

**User-visible outcome:** All screens share the same elegant typography, premium gradient palette, and cohesive blush-glass card styling, with readable text and consistent button accents.
