  "summary": "Diff implements the requested global font loading and font classes (Playfair Display for headings, Poppins/Inter for body), applies the specified plum→rose background gradient and romantic color tokens, updates buttons to use the new accent/muted rose palette, and updates GlassCard to a blush-tinted glass effect with a pink bloom pseudo-element. One acceptance criterion about preferring shared/global styling over one-off overrides appears not fully met due to inline styles on the Celebration replay button.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "All changes are implemented via shared/global styles (e.g., frontend/src/index.css and Tailwind theme tokens) rather than one-off per-screen overrides, except where necessary for layout.",
      "reason": "CelebrationScreen applies secondary button styling via inline background/border styles instead of a shared/global class or token-based style, which conflicts with the stated preference for shared/global styling for palette updates.",
